# Minecraft Taiga Moon
## Info
This mod adds one new moon --- the Taiga. It was made by modifying a small portion of a naturally generated spruce forest in Minecraft to add doors for a main entrance and 3 fire exits. 

The workflow for creating these Minecraft-moons was created by me, and can be found in the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/lcmod) under ["Minecraft Maps"](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1188741942100635668) in the development resources channel.
