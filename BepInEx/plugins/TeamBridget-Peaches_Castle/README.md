# Peach's Castle Has Come to Lethal Company!

Adds the castle grounds of Peach's Castle as a playable moon!</br >
This map is still a work in progress, so please look forward to future updates.</br >
If you have any feedback please contact me at [terra.ulf](https://discord.com/users/197634107495284736) on Discord, or @ me in the LC Modding [Discord](https://discord.gg/XeyYqRdRGC).</br >

### Installation

The moon should automatically install if using the mod manager.</br >
For manual installation, drag and drop the `BepInEx` folder into your LC root folder, or drag and drop `castlegrounds.lem` directly into your `Modules` folder.</br >
Be sure you have all the required dependencies installed before downloading.</br >
All players in the lobby are required to have the mod for it to work.
